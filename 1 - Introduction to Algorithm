First of all, I am actually learning English, so I'll use this repository to practice it as long I learn how to code...

So, i this first class it was presented the description of algorithm:
	"It's a sequence of steps which intend to solve problems"
	A good wway to practice, was a short game caled 'Hora do c√≥digo Minecraft" which uses the game's interface to teach algorithm.
	Link: https://studio.code.org/s/mc
	
It was presented the description of "pseudocode", which you write all the steps using the speaking language intead of using programming language.
And to put in practice the pseudocode, it was indicated to write the steps for the game "Pinguins numa Fria". Link: https://rachacuca.com.br/jogos/pinguins-numa-fria/
	So the pseudocode was written:
	START OF THE GAME
	select = adult red, baby red
	pass
	select - adult red
	pass
	select + baby green
	pass
	select - baby red
	pass
	select + adult green
	pass
	select - adult green
	pass
	select + baby blue
	pass
	select - baby green
	pass
	select + adult blue
	pass
	select - adult blue - baby blue
	END OF THE GAME
